Known Limitations
- Can not spoof-proof the `Object` constructor.
- Non-private method of allowing access to the Lapys Development Kit namespace.
- The huge collection of features of the Lapys Development Kit might make the script file slow to parse and the object data slow to integrate within the host environment.
